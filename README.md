# Some Thought
The article throws in some questions regarding AI generated contents and whether it can be 'creative' to the level of humans. To set standards to what may be considered as an 'art', it brings in concepts as being autonomous and having singularity. After showing various worries, she concludes that we can never be all-knowing and perfect as a machine, but at the same time a machine can't be us. She says that an AI is merely a tool for art, at least for now. However, instead of saying that it is impossible for AI art to be beautiful, I feel like the real question is: what if it is beautiful? What should we do when AI starts to win Pulitzer Prize? How should we evaluate the role of technology in the creation of art and journalism? It's about being ready, not about being scared.

Would an AI tool capable of winning the Pulitzer deserve it? If it is able to create beautiful things, what then is differentiating it's ability to create from a human's?
